# Sponsorship
Role of sponsorship team/lead

* Identify likely sponsors
* Inquire whether those sponsors will contribute

Guidelines and rules

* Sponsorship does not equal speaking slot
* Sponsors will need to pay upfront to make the event work
* Sponsors cannot commercialize the event
* Sponsorship should cover 80-90% of total even budget
* Signing up sponsorships is a lot of work - two volunteers are better than one 
* Anchor sponsors will make it easy to get follow-on sponsors
* Sponsorship team works very closely with the finance team

Setting up sponsorship offerings

* Sponsorship tier structure
* Sample prospectus template <link>
* The standard is Platinum, Gold, Silver, etc
* Additional sponsorship opportunities include - the coffee breaks, the happy hour, conference schwag, lunch
* Feel free to be creative with sponsorship offerings
* Be very clear in communicating with sponsors what they are getting and what the are NOT getting

Seeking out sponsorships

* Ideally one of the organizers will work for a sponsor
* Identify local companies that might want to sponsor
* Often CNCF members really like to sponsor community events (it builds their community cred)
