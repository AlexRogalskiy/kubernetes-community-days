# Kubernetes Community Days Content & Programing
Basic Guidelines

* Encourage bold, innovative, thought-provoking subjects
* Events usually have four 30-minute talks per day + ignite talks
* Open space sessions are scheduled during the conference, not ahead of time (have attendees vote on topics during the event)
* Always sensitive and appropriate
* Have fun and promote fun
* Encourage interaction

## Recruiting Speakers

* The [CNCF Speakers Bureau](https://www.cncf.io/speakers/) is a great place to start
* Expect to recruit people for speaker proposals
 * Have a good stock of proposal ideas ready to offer to potential speakers to spark their creative process
  * Offer to brainstorm with them to help create content
   * Reach out to known event speakers on the CNCF Slack and ask if they have ideas that might be good (or if they want to speak at the event!)
* Recruiting a diverse speaker slate requires extra effort
 * Contact organizations like [Women Who Code](https://www.womenwhocode.com/) and [Black Girl’s Code](http://www.blackgirlscode.com/)
 * Check relevant meetups for past speakers
  * Consider bringing in speakers from outside the region to improve diversity
* Kubernetes Community Days follow the Linux Foundation policy of prohibiting all male panels. Since speakers sometimes need to cancel at the least minute, aim for two or more women on a panel so you won’t need to cancel it if one woman is unable to attend.
* Announce the Call for Proposals (CFP) as early as possible - including open date, close date, and the date people will be informed of selection
 * People will usually need at least 4-6 weeks to arrange for travel or time off
 * Keep the call for papers open for at least a month
 * Allow 2 weeks to consider proposals and fill in any gaps


## Judging proposals

* To minimize bias, create a reasonable proposal rating system
* Set a point scale for each of the proposal points (e.g. originality, big idea, new speaker, high quality speaker) and award each proposal points on the scale then aggregate points for scores
* Publish the proposal rating systems and be transparent about it
* Publish the names of the programming committee
* Be prepared to explain any programming decisions

## Content considerations

* Encourage new content; give higher priority to content that has not been published elsewhere
* Try for a good balance between local and out-of-town speakers
* Favor new speakers: Kubernetes Community Days is a supportive environment to encourage new voices in our space

## Set up a clear timeline on content reviews

* Regularly check-in with speakers to ensure they are making progress
* Schedule at least two live video run-throughs of presentations before the event
* Have the orgnizeres or members of the program committeer review every presentation in advance to ensure that content is appropriate
* Identify all A/V requirements for each presentation
 * Do they need video playback?
 * Live coding?
* The day of event make sure to check in with all speakers and ensure they are OK
* Post-event, provide constructive feedback on the speaker’s presentation with concrete advice
