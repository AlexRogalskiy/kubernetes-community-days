title: Organize a Kubernetes Community Days

# About Kubernetes Community Days 
Kubernetes Community Days are community-organized events that gather adopters and technologists from open source and cloud native communities to learn, collaborate, and network to further adoption and improvement of Kubernetes. They are supported by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). They also are a lot of fun and a great way to meet new people and build community. Each event brings its own local flair, culture, diversity, and authenticity.  

We would like to give a hearty thank you to [DevOpsDays](https://devopsdays.org) and [OpenStack Days](https://www.openstack.org) for their guidance and inspiration and, in particular, for providing the basis of this document.
                      
# Interested in Hosting a Kubernetes Community Days?

Kubernetes Community Days organization is decentralized. Local events handle their own sponsorships, registration, and all other logistics. Check to see if there is a Kubernetes Community Days event scheduled in your area on the events page. If there is already an event scheduled, please reach out to the organizers to express your interest in helping. Their email is on the contact page of their event.

If there isn’t an event being organized, the first step in building out a successful event is assembling a team. You can often find local community members who may be interested in helping to organize or volunteer at local user groups and Meetups, such as the [CNCF Meetup groups](https://www.meetup.com/pro/cncf/).

Check the GitHub Repo [project board](https://github.com/cncf/kubernetes-community-days/projects/2) for other individuals who have expressed an interest in organizing an event in your area. If there are no GitHub issues for your area, create an [issue](https://github.com/cncf/kubernetes-community-days/issues/new?assignees=christinevblum%2C+iennae&labels=planningevent&template=interest.md) to express your interest in organizing an event in your area. 

CNCF helps support Kubernetes Community Days with guidance and promotion. This document and the ones it links to cover all the aspects of holding a successful event. Please keep in mind that Kubernetes Community Day events are focused on community engagement. Organizers and speakers need to avoid sales pitches in crafting the program for their event. Kubernetes Community Days events are inclusive. This also means making reasonable efforts to work with others in the community who want to help organize, attend, or sponsor, regardless of their organizational affiliation.

## Getting Started Checklist

* No other Kubernetes Community Day event in the local area
* Minimum of 3 organizers from 2 different organizations, and ideally 5 or more organizers
* Organizers are local to the event location
* At least one organizer is a CNCF member employee, [Ambassador](https://www.cncf.io/people/ambassadors/), or CNCF project [maintainer](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1Pr8cyp8RLrNGx9WBAgQvBzUUmqyOv69R7QAFKhacJEM/)
* You have a method to accept payments, including sponsorships, and to pay out expenses
* All organizers have agreed to these event guidelines and to abide by the Kubernetes Community Day [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct/)

Once your organizing team is arranged and meets these criteria, create an [issue](https://github.com/cncf/kubernetes-community-days/issues/new?assignees=christinevblum%2C+iennae&labels=newevent&template=host.md) to get your event officially recognized. Your organizing team will be invited to the [#kcd-organizers](https://cloud-native.slack.com/messages/GN6R2PV1A) private Slack channel where you can connect with other Kubernetes Community Days organizers around the world. You can then begin creating your website, by copying the page structure of the [Bouvet Island](https://kubernetescommunitydays.org/events/2020-bouvet-island/) event. Here are [directions](/organizing-creating-website) to do so.

## Event Details 

Most events are developer-focused. Some are more focused on business issues and cloud strategy. Events normally have 100-400 attendees. Most start small and grow each year. The overarching rule about content is that Kubernetes Community Days are not to be used for commercial pitches. Any platforms or tools you are describing need to be open source. That said, many (most?) talks will be about how companies relied on open source technologies to improve their processes. If the event creates a profit, it needs to be held and reinvested in future years. Organizers should aim to get all of their actual expenses reimbursed, but not their time.

Other considerations:

* Encourage bold, innovative, thought-provoking subjects
* Events usually have four 30-minute talks per day
* Open space sessions are scheduled during the conference, not ahead of time. You should have attendees vote on topics during the event.
* The event needs to be at least a one day long
* We recommend offering lower, early bird registration
* Registration and sponsorship needs to be available to anyone until the available capacity sells out 
* Encourage interaction
* The attendee list may not be used for commercial or marketing purposes. It may only be used to advertise that specific Kubernetes Community Day or further iterations of it. The list may not be shared with third parties who are not directly involved in organizing the event. Please review the [Privacy Policy Statement](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/privacy/).
* Sponsors are allowed to collect attendee information at their tables

## Logos and Trademarks
Once your event has been accepted, you are authorized by CNCF to use that name (e.g., Kubernetes Community Days Bouvet Island). We encourage you to design a custom logo for your event. Please note that the logo can’t include all or part of the Kubernetes wheel, but does need to include the event name. You are welcome to include the CNCF logo in your event logo and graphics, and you’re also welcome to use [Phippy](https://phippy.io/) and friends (high-res versions available in the artwork [repo](https://github.com/cncf/artwork/blob/master/examples/other.md#phippy--friends-group-logos)).

Please post your logo in SVG format, as [explained](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2019/07/17/what-image-formats-should-you-be-using-in-2019/) in this blog post.
 
All events must be called "Kubernetes Community Days Bouvet Island", with Bouvet Island replaced by the location of your event.
